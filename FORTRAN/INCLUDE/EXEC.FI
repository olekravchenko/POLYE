$LIST
C       EXEC.FI - Interface file for C system and spawnlp routines

C       These functions are discussed in Chapter 3 of the Advanced Topics
C       manual. The program DEMOEXEC.FOR illustrates how to use the include
C       file and the functions.


C       Function:       SYSTEM
C
C       Purpose:        Starts a child copy of the DOS system shell
C                       program--COMMAND.COM
C
C       Argument:       string - A string (in C format) consisting
C                       of a DOS command, program, or batch file name
C                       followed optionally by arguments
C
C       Return:         INTEGER*2 - 0 for success, or -1 for fail
C
C       Example:        dummy2 = SYSTEM( 'dir *.for'C )

        INTERFACE TO FUNCTION SYSTEM[C] (STRING)
        INTEGER*2 SYSTEM
        CHARACTER*1 STRING[REFERENCE]
        END


C       Function:       SPAWNLP
C
C       Purpose:        Starts a child copy of a specified program
C
C       Arguments:      mode - Must be 0
C
C                       path - Address of a string (in C format) containing
C                       path name of program to be executed (may be partial
C                       if the program is in PATH or current directory)
C
C                       arg0 - Must be same as path
C
C                       arg1,...,argn - Addresses of command-line argument
C                       strings (in C format) to be passed to the program.
C                       Last argument must be INT4(0)
C
C       Return:         INTEGER*2 - return code of process or -1 for fail
C
C       Example:        dummy2 = SPAWNLP( 0,
C                      +                  LOC( 'format'C ),
C                      +                  LOC( 'format''C ),
C                      +                  LOC( 'a:'C ),
C                      +                  INT4( 0 ) )
C

        INTERFACE TO FUNCTION SPAWNLP [C,VARYING] (MODE)
        INTEGER*2 MODE,SPAWNLP
        END
